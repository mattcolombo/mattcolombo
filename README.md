- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mattia. Originally italian, I have now lived in the UK for over 8 years. Since life is not all about work, I spend my time outside of my job doing some more programming and learning about technology... and also cycling around the country.
- ðŸŒ± I like to learn. Full stop. Anything is cool ðŸ˜„. Currently I am learning some Go and and NodeJS alongside improving my knowledge about k8s and Apache Kafka.
